## Getting started

Kengin is a game engine for making virtual experiences. It's based around the
popular [OpenUsd](https://openusd.org) which means it's a great choice for
games that involve creative play.

Kengin gives you an easy way to create virtual experiences and share them with
others. It includes features like:

- An easy to use Editor to create virtual Experiences
- A set of game services, like multiplayer network services
- A low level set of libraries for fine grained control over virtual worlds

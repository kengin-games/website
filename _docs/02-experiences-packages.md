## Overview

An Experiences Package is a container for Experiences. It allows you to group
together related Experiences into one unit. For example a Package could 
represent a game which has a collection of Experiences for each level in the 
game.

We've chosen the generic term Experience because you can use Kengin in lots of
scenarios not just games.

### Experiences

An Experience is a generic term for a virtual scene. It could represent things
like:

- A complete game, if the game is small enough to fit in one scene
- A game level in a larger game.
- An animated scene, which might be is part of a bigger story
- A visualisation that you want to share with others, for example an 
  architectural view of a building with some interactive elements to show how
  processes will work

### Packages

Packages are the wrapper around Experiences. The let us group together related
Experiences, like grouping all the levels in a game.

This also makes it easier to deploy packages so you can share you creations with
others.

## Working with Packages

When you create a new virtual world in Kengin, you start by making a Package.
This is your workspace for the project.

Please see the Experiences Package tutorial for a guided walk through the 
process.

We are delighted to announce we have received funding from the 
[DCMS Create Growth fund][dcms-create-growth] from Innovate UK!

This funding will allow us to create the Kengin Metaverse MVP to let game
designers build new worlds.

Kengin is a game engine that is purpose built to support large worlds with many 
players. We make it easy to create and deploy new games, enabling fast iteration 
of interactive experiences. The project supports creative play, allowing users 
to create and mix content in real time.

This project focuses on building out the core services. This consists of an 
adaptive client app that sits on the user's computer which connects to a 
flexible set of server components that efficiently process game world state.

We'll release a demo in late 2023 - please come back often to check for updates!
